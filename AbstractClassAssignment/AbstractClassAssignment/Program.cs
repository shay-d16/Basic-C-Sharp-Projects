        //1. Create an abstract class called Person with two properties: string firstName and string lastName.
        //2. Give it the method SayName().
        //3. Create another class called Employee and have it inherit from the Person class.
        //4. Implement the SayName() method inside of the Employee class.
        //5. Inside the Main() method, instantiate an Employee object with firstName “Sample” and lastName
        //   “Student”. Call the SayName() method on the object.
        static void Main(string[] args)

            employee.SayName();
