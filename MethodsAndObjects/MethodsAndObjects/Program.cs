        //1. Create a class called Person and give it two properties, each of data type string.
        //   One called FirstName, the other LastName.
        //2. Give this class a void method called SayName() that takes no parameters and simply
        //   writes the person's full name to the console in the format of: “Name: [full name]”.
        //3. Create another class called Employee and have it inherit from the Person class.
        //   Give the Employee class a property called Id and have it be of data type int.
        //4. Inside of the Main method, instantiate and initialize an Employee object with a
        //   first name of “Sample” and a last name of “Student”.
        //5. Call the superclass method SayName() on the Employee object.

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            //Instantiate and initialize 'employee' object and it's new values.
            Employee employee = new Employee() { FirstName = "Sample", LastName = "Student" };            

            //Call the superclass SayName() method on the 'employee' object.
            employee.SayName();
            Console.ReadLine();
        }
    }
