# Basic-C-Sharp-Projects
=============================

These are some small projects I have created using C# and the .NET Framework. I also utilized the Entity Framework and MVC Design pattern in some of these applications.

## Projects:

- Newsletter Sign Up App
- Car Insurance App
- A TwentyOne card game application

### Newsletter Sign Up

This MVC application utilizes ADO.NET to connect a database to a C# project. The user is able to sign up for newsletters. There is also an admin feature that allows administrators to view the current information in the database, and modify that information in the form of unsibscibing users from the mailing list.

### Car Insurance

This project is also an MVC application. Users are able to create their own profile and receive a generated "quote" based the information they input. They are also able to
edit this information, and it will all be modified in the database.

### TwentyOne Game

This project is a console application that generates a game of Twenty One between the user and the computer. The user is able to make bets, choose to "hit" or "stay", can see what cards they have at all times, and receive thier calculated balance when they decide to stop playing.
